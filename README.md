MC++ is a high-level programming language compiled for Minecraft commands.
Originaly, It was for a christmas present for my friend who's making RPG on Minecraft. (And as you though, the name of this project is a parody of C++)
I began this project with Python, but after I made a prototype, I noticed that's it's too dull. So I learnt Rust, and rewrite it in Rust programming language.
Now, MC++ supporting formula parsing, function definemenet, variable definement.
